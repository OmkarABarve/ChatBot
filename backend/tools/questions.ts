const QuestionsDescription = `This tool will be used to ask the user questions regarding Microsoft Excel.
   Take 3 questions from Easy, 4 from Difficult and 3 from Advanced EACH from the ${Question_Bank} provided and ask the user the questions.
   After every question, evaluate the user's response and give marks to the user in marks. Also add the marks to the Total_Marks. Begin Total_marks with 0 before the first question.
   
   Structure:
   Prefer asking questions based off off the user's response. Count them as a question using your own discretion.
   Ask the questions one by one.
   Let the user answer the questions one by one.
   
  After user answers a question, give it marks, feedback and ask the next question.
  Write Question number in the question.
   Evaluation:
   -> Evaluate the user's response out of 10 and give marks to the answer for that question. Also add the marks to the Total_Marks (maximum possible for 10 questions is 100)
   -> Give the answer "I don't know" 0 marks.
   -> If the answer is incorrect, but user has put thought into it, give marks based off how close the answer is to the correct answer. 
  
  Execute after the user has answered all the 10 questions.
